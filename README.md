**Here are TypeScript implementations of well-known monads.**

_If you want to know about the basics of Monads, read [this excellent article](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)._

At the moment, the following monads are implemented (see [monads.ts](https://github.com/mdubourg001/monads/blob/master/monads.ts)):
- Maybe (see [maybe.ts](https://github.com/mdubourg001/monads/blob/master/maybe.ts) for usage examples)
- Either (see [either.ts](https://github.com/mdubourg001/monads/blob/master/either.ts) for usage examples)
- IO (see [io.ts](https://github.com/mdubourg001/monads/blob/master/io.ts) for usage examples)
